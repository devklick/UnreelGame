A `logic sector` is a category of `sector`. There are many different types of `logic sector`.
Unlike the `value selector`, they do not represent a `value`. Instead, they represent a piece of functionality.
When the spinner lands on the logic selector, the logic is executed. This may result in the spinner being nudged, being held on the next spin, etc.
