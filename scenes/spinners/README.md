A `spinner` is essentially slot machine reel on it's side.
It will spin in either a `clockwise` or `anti-clockwise` until user input is received to stop the `spinner`.
The `spinner` is evenly split into a set number of `sectors`. See `sectors` info for more.
The idea is to match up multiple sectors to win prizes.
