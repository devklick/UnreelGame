A simple 2D game created with Godot. Very much a WI(slow)P.

The game consists of a number of reels which the players spins and stops. The idea is to get all reels to stop on the same icon. 

The reel may land on a value icon - the idea is to get the reels all end up on the same value.
Or the reel may land on a logic icon - which could do something like:
- Nudge the reel x times
- Hold the reel for the next x spins
- Speed the reel up on the next x spins
- Slow the reel down on the next x spins
